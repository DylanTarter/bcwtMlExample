# Backwards Coding of Wavelet Trees (BCWT) in Matlab!
Provided are the support materials for my paper on the BCWT Algorithm

BCWT.ml is a function that performs the compression
iBCWT.ml is a function that performs the decompression

EncodingExample & DecodingExample are livescripts that use the BCWT & iBCWT functions to demonstrate how the encoding works
